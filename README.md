# Overview

This was my first Java project, so I tried to take this opportunity to implement 
many of the characteristics that sets Java apart from other languages I've learned.
This led to a lot of research during the course of the project, and I feel like
I gained a much deeper understanding of the Java language and what it can be used
to accomplish in software development.

The expense tracker that I wrote in Java is able to input a user's expenses, which 
can be retrieved at a later time by selecting a particular month and year to view
all the expenses that were made during that time interval.

I wrote this expense tracker because it gave me a great opportunity to implement
objects from many different libraries in Java, including Scanner, LocalDate, String,
HashMap, ArrayList, and File. There were also many opportunities in this project to 
explore the different kinds of exceptions that can be thrown in Java.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
